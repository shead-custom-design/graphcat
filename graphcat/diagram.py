    """Create a diagram of a computational graph.

    This is extremely useful for understanding and debugging computational
    graphs.  The structure and current state is converted to a PyGraphviz
    graph.  By default, each task is rendered as a box with the task label.
    Arrows are drawn between tasks, pointing from upstream producers of data to
    downstream consumers.  Arrows are labelled to show named inputs, if any.
    The color of each box shows its state: white for unfinished tasks, red for
    tasks that are failed, and black for tasks that are finished.

    Callers can customize the appearance of the graph by modifying the result
    before rendering it to an image or Jupyter notebook.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph: :class:`graphcat.graph.Graph` derivative or :class:`pygraphviz.AGraph`, required
        The graph to be visualized.
    hide: Python callable, optional
        Python callable that can be used to hide tasks in the displayed figure.
        If :any:`None` (the default), all tasks will be displayed.  Ignored if
        `graph` is an instance of :class:`pygraphviz.AGraph`.
    rankdir: :class:`str`, optional
        Graphviz rankdir attribute that determines the direction of data flow
        within the diagram.  Default: ``"LR"``, which is left-to-right flow.
        Ignored if `graph` is an instance of :class:`pygraphviz.AGraph`.

    Returns
    -------
    diagram: :class:`pygraphviz.AGraph`
        Diagrammatic representation of `graph`.  Callers can modify `diagram`
        as needed before using its layout and drawing methods to produce a
        final image.

    See Also
    --------
    :func:`graphcat.notebook.display` - displays a graph in a Jupyter notebook.
