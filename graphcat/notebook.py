    This is extremely useful for understanding and debugging graphs.  The

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph: :class:`graphcat.Graph` or :class:`pygraphviz.AGraph`, required
        The graph to be visualized.
    hide: Python callable, optional
        Python callable that can be used to hide tasks in the displayed figure.
        If :any:`None` (the default), all tasks will be displayed.  Ignored if
        `graph` is a :class:`pygraphviz.AGraph`.
    rankdir: :class:`str`, optional
        Graphviz rankdir attribute that determines the direction of data flow
        within the diagram.  Default: ``"LR"``, which is left-to-right flow.
        Ignored if `graph` is a :class:`pygraphviz.AGraph`.
