    "Streaming Graphs\n",
    "================\n",
    "\n",
    "This section assumes you've completed the :ref:`tutorial` and have a good working knowledge of Graphcat.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen so far, computational graphs capture the dependencies in a process so that individual tasks can be executed only when they're needed.  Static graphs identify those tasks based solely on the topology of the graph.  :ref:`Dynamic graphs<dynamic-graphs>` improve on this by detecting which task outputs are actually used, so that tasks with unused outputs can be skipped.  The section on :ref:`avoiding unnecessary updates<avoiding-updates>` describes how Graphcat takes this a step further by ensuring that irrelevant upstream changes don't trigger downstream execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we introduce *streaming graphs*, which make it possible to retrieve a subset of a task's total output.  This can be useful in several ways: first, you might want to improve interactivity by reducing the work performed when there are minor upstream changes.  An example of this might be a paint program where only the region under a brush stroke is updated, instead of an entire image.  Another reason to use streaming is when you have a problem so large that it can't be loaded into memory all at once: you can split the problem into smaller pieces and work on them one at a time, only accumulating the final result.  Finally, you can use streaming to implement parallelism, using multiple threads or processes to each work on one piece of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we can get to all that, let's begin with a simple streaming graph that computes the squares of values in a :class:`Numpy array<numpy.ndarray>`:"

    "There's a lot to unpack here.  First, we specified an extent when we called :meth:`output<graphcat.graph.Graph.output>`.  An extent (which can only be used in streaming graphs) is any Python object that can be used by a task to specify a subset of its output.  In this case, we used :class:`graphcat.ArrayExtent<graphcat.common.ArrayExtent>`, which can be thought of as a factory for creating extents that request a subset of an array using standard `Numpy indexing <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.indexing.html>`_.  Here, we are requesting the first four values from the array (``ArrayExtent[0:4]``).\n",

    "        return numpy.power(inputs.getone(None, extent), 2)\n",

This is an important point when working with streaming graphs: the task functions must be written to accept the \"extent\" argument along with the standard \"graph\", \"name\", and \"inputs\" arguments, and do something with the extent information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the `squared` function, the extent is simply passed-along in the call to `inputs.getone(None, extent)` ... in other words, `squared` is counting on the upstream task providing its input to know what to do with the extents object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we used :func:`graphcat.array<graphcat.common.array>` to implement task \"A\", because it knows how to use the extent returned by :class:`graphcat.ArrayExtent<graphcat.common.ArrayExtent>`, using it to return a subset of the stored array.\n",
