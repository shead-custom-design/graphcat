Compatibility
=============

A quick disclaimer on backwards-compatibility for Graphcat users:

Graphcat follows the `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ standard for
assigning version numbers in a way that has specific meaning.  Graphcat version
numbers follow *<major>.<minor>.<patch>* numbering.  Releases with different
major API numbers are API incompatible.  Minor version numbers signify new
features that are backwards-compatible with the current major version.  Patch
numbers indicate bug fixes and documentation changes that are
backwards-compatible with the current major and minor version.
