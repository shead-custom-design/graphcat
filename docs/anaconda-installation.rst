Anaconda Installation
=====================

Whether youâ€™re new to Python or an old hand, we highly recommend installing
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. Anaconda includes and
conveniently installs Python and other commonly used packages for scientific
computing and data science, including many of Graphcat's dependencies.
